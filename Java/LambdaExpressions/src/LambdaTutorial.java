    /*
    * Welcome to Lambda expressions in Java tutorial.
    *
    * First, lets figure out what lambda expressions are!
    * Lambdas provide a clear and concise way to represent ONE method interface using an expression (anonymous inner classes).
    * All this means is that it allows you to easily and quickly write a method, that might will be used only once,
    * and you don't have to wright the entire method, with head and body. Only the body of the method.
    *
    * Lambda expressions also improve the Collection libraries making it easier to iterate through, filter, and extract data from a Collection.
    * We will see examples of this, and explain it in depth.
    *
    * Lambda will make you write simpler code, and execute functional programming, and also write less lines of code,
    * and for-loops.
    *
    * */

    /*
    * FUNCTIONAL INTERFACES
    *
    * To understand and be able to write lambda expressions, you need to understand and know
    * what a functional interface is.
    *
    * All it is, is a interface, that has only / exactly one method defined.
    * The method, takes in arguments, and returns a result.
    *
    * There is only one requirement to the class that implements the interface,
    * and that is, that the method defined in the interface, is the only method in the class that implements it.
    *
    * It's as simple as that.
    * */

    /*
    * Lambda expressions
    *
    * The difference between a Functional Interface and a lambda expresisons is;
    * that he lambda expression only cares about what the interface method is suppose to do and return.
    * And lets us implement and use only that. We doen't have write a interface and a class that implements that interface,
    * and then implement the method, then use the method.
    *
    * Lambda expressions uses the operator "->"
    * To the left of the "arrow / ->" the arguments that are given to the method is provided,
    * and to the right of the "arrow / ->" the body of the method is defined and what to return.
    *
    * */

    /*
    * Pre defined functional interfaces from Java.
    *
    * Predicate : a method "Test" that takes in an object as a argument, and returns a boolean
    *
    * Consumer : a method "accept" that takes in a object as argument, and returns nothing (void)
    *
    * BinaryOparator<T> : a method "apply" that takes in two objects of the given type <T>, and returns ONE object of the type <T>
    *      example is addition: takes in two doubles, and returns the sum as a double .
    *

    /*
    * Lets get started!
    *
    * Now that all the boring theory is overwith, lets get to the good part, CODING!
    * To illustrate Lambda expressions, we will create a basic and simple person class (see Person.class),
    * that we will be using the Lambda expressions on.
    *
    * When we have implemented the Person class, we will create a list of persons, and then
    * add 5 person object to the list. So we have some data to play with.

    /* How to use lambda expression to sort a ArrayList.
    *
    * Since we call sort on the list we want to sort, sort takes in two and two (the arguemnts) persons from the persons list
    * and sends them into the expression. Then the expression compares and sorts, and then returns the order of the two persons
    *
    * This happens for the entire list, and therfore the list is sorted.
    * We just saved a bunch of lines! #Sweet.
